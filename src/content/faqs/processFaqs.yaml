  - question: How much does a website redesign cost?
    answer: Every project is different, and costs will depend on the size of the scope and length of the timeline. Often it is appropriate to engage in a preliminary Discovery Phase to set a scope for larger projects. That said, $5,000 is a useful starting point for a smaller, low functionality site; $10,000+ for a larger, content- and feature-rich site. <a href="/contact"><strong>Reach out</strong> to get a custom quote</a> for your website project.
  - question: How long does a website redesign take?
    answer: Again, this will depend on the project scope and on the readiness of content and imagery upon commencement; but 6–8 weeks is typical for a faster project; 4–6 months for a longer project.
  - question: Will I be able to make changes to the website on my own after it launches?
    answer: Yes, if this is something we determine your site needs during the planning phase, I’ll make a suggestion for a content management system (CMS) that non-technical users can use to make ongoing changes to the site (some of my recommended solutions include Statamic and Sanity).
  - question: What tools do you use to make websites? What is a web framework?
    answer: My main tools are the basic technologies of the web that have been around since 1996—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In most cases, however, I’ll make use of an open-source web framework like <a href="/services/frontend-development#frameworks">Astro or Laravel</a> to make the process of generating code more efficient. Frameworks come in many shapes and sizes but usually offer a standard set of tools and practices to work with backend (server) and/or frontend (user-facing or browser) code. As a client, you won’t normally have to think about these technologies I use, with the exception of projects that utilize a content management system, which are sometimes built into frameworks.
  - question: Do you offer hosting?
    answer: As a freelance web design studio, I don’t offer support for website hosting, email, or other technical/IT services. In most cases, I will recommend a provider and ask you to set up an account to manage your website through that provider.
  - question: Do you offer maintenance and support plans?
    answer: Once your site is launched, it is important to me that you own the site in its entirety and that you are free to take it wherever you want to do whatever you want with it; ultimately the updates, management, and security of the site are up to you. However, I also offer <a href="/services/ongoing-support">no-contract developer support plans</a> to give you ongoing professional assistance as your site grows and changes.
  - question: Are there other aspects of a website redesign not included in your process that I should be aware of?
    answer: Yes, there are a few other services and costs that you’ll want to consider as part of a website redesign which are not included in what I offer. Some examples include <strong>copywriting and copyediting</strong> of text content, sourcing <strong>graphics and photography</strong>, and setting up <strong>website analytics</strong>. For some of these, I can offer my recommendations and help you integrate them with the site, but they fall under your responsibility.
