  - question: How much does a new website cost?
    answer: This a bit like asking “how much does a car or house cost?” The answer will depend on the features and overall scope that best fit your goals, and how much you are able to invest to realize those goals. That said, we normally work with budgets in the $6,000 to $25,000 range. We also offer discounts for individuals or start-ups needing small portfolio sites or landing pages. Take a look at our pricing estimates to learn more.
  - question: Will I be able to make changes to the website on my own after it launches?
    answer: Most websites will come with a content management system (CMS) that will make updating your site easy and intuitive. Some of our favorite, modern CMS solutiuons include Sanity and Statamic.
