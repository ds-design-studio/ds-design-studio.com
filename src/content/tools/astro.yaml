title: Astro
summary: <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> is a modern, minimal framework for building content-driven websites. Its “bring-you-own-tools” approach integrates well with virtually any existing UI library, third-party API, or headless CMS. Astro is my go-to choice for building bespoke, small- to medium-sized marketing and content sites.
