    "The Writing Freedom Fellowship is a new Haymarket initiative (in partnership with the Mellon Foundation and the Arts for Justice Fund) that highlights poets, fiction writers, and non-fiction writers impacted by carceral systems. I was honored to design and build the accompanying standalone website for this important program.",

To encourage exploration of the fellows’ stories and facilitate sharing them across platforms, the site’s user navigation path was designed to end up on individual fellow pages, where users can read fellow biographies and hear audio clips of fellows reading from their works.",

Importantly, I developed flexible schemas that will help retain the same ease of management as the program continues to grow with more fellows each year.",
