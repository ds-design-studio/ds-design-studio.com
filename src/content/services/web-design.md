When we work together, the design process will be highly dialectical and iterative. That is, there is usually a lot of back and forth between us, a lot of refining, before we settle on a design that works for everyone. It's rare that a solution is discovered right off the bat with no further adjustments (rare, but not impossible!).

Of course, this process goes both ways—I expect a pretty high level of engagement from clients when we're just starting out. Having consistent interaction and feedback during the content planning and design phases is what ensures a final product that meets expectations and achieves goals.

In most circumstances, I'll prefer to use live development sites to show dynamic design work in the context of the browser. Static visuals can be useful for high-level, broad-brush stroke ideas, but nothing compares to seeing and interacting with the design in its live setting.
