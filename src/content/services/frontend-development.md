prologue: Building a site doesn’t have to be overly complicated. I favor modern tools that prioritize speed, simplicity, and a fantastic experience for the end user. But rather than simply chasing the latest fads, I believe that betting on the web platform itself can produce sites that save time, money, and headaches in the long run.

In all things web development, [my philosophy](/process#principles) is to stay simple until you need to get complex. But even when complexity is called for, I try to approach it in the simplest way possible.

Every site and use case is different, but there are sensible defaults that usually work for most small- to medium-sized projects to reduce complexity and boost project success: **prefer pre-rendered/static site builds** before jumping to a server, **prefer vanilla JavaScript and web components** before jumping to a bulky library like React, **prefer known and trusted systems** to unknown novelties.

Reducing complexity not only makes for more secure code that is easier to maintain, it also helps "future-proof" a site. This means that as technology and trends change, your site stays resilient and able to deliver content without breaking or needing a major overhaul.
